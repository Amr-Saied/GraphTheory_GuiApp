# GraphTheory_GuiApp

This is my DataStructure Project wich is a good practice on the GraphTheory and DataStructures,
My application takes graph data from user and store it in files, it also gives the choice of displaying data using graphical user interface by BFS Algorithm, 
Dfs Algorithm, and normal displaying of the stored Data in files, also it gives the choice to the user to update and modify the stored data in the application
i also used a very good and friendly gui to make it user for the user to use my application
